# mimir

A commandline based tool for synchronising secrets between kubernetes, and an external hosted secrets management platform

## Supported Backends

Currently both Hashicorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager are supported

## Remote Managed Secrets

### Hashicorp Vault

For Hashicorp Vault, secrets to be managed are based on the path inside the vault when using a kv engine type. Essentially, mimir will scan the vault based on the `mount` provided to the CLI. It will, within there check for any directories matching a namespace in the cluster, and load in any secrets within that directory.

For example, a secret at the following path: `https://myvault.mydomain/v1/secret/default/example` in vault would be loaded in to the `default` namespace with the name `example`. Both kv engine v1 & v2 are supported. The tool is not limited to top level, and an optional path variable can be provided to set a root path for secrets within a mount.

### AWS Secrets Manager

Secrets managed in AWS are based on tags. Create secrets in AWS as normal, but to sync them, the following two tags should be added:

* Key: `mimir-managed`, Value: `true/false` - Sets a true or false string on if the secret should be synced with kubernetes
* Key: `mimir-paths`, Value: `{namespace1}/{secret}+{namespace2}/{secret}` - Provided list of `+` separated paths on where the secret should sync to in k8s. Path format is namespace / secret, and will be loaded into the cluster this way.

## Running mimir

Mimir can be run via commandline on any windows/macOS/linux system via a command line interface. Alternatively, the provided helm chart at that `chart` path will allow you to deploy the application onto a cluster, where it will run as a crojob.

For running it via the backend, the following are the top level CLI arguments that must be passed in.
